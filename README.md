# Chance-Constrained Heterogeneous and Multi-trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

A Python-based model for solving the **Chance-Constrained a Heterogeneous and Multi-trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CC-HMTVRPTW)** using **IBM CPLEX** and an **improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)**. 

---

## **Features**

- **Energy Consumption Optimization**:  
  Minimize the energy consumed by cargo bikes and the riders during deliveries.
  
- **Constraints**:  
  - **Vehicle Capacity Limits**: Ensure cargo bikes do not exceed their load capacity.
  - **Customer Time Windows**: Deliveries must be completed within specified time windows.
  - **Rider Fatigue**: Limit trip durations based on rider fatigue levels.
  - **Battery Constraints**: Ensure deliveries do not exceed the cargo bike's battery capacity.

- **Modified ALNS**
  - **Initial Solution Generation**: Based on fatigue-dependent travel times and shift overlaps.
  - **ALNS Heuristic**: Adaptive algorithm with multiple destroy and repair operators.

## **Requirements**

- **Python 3.12.4**
- **IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio**
- **`docplex` Library**

### **Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-shift-vrp-alns.git
cd multi-shift-vrp-alns
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š **Usage**

### 1. **Prepare Data**

Update the `main.py` with your own:

- **Customers**: Latitude, longitude, demand, and time windows.
- **Depot**: Central starting location for vehicles.
- **Vehicles**: Specifications including mass, capacity, and battery range.
- **Shifts**: Time windows for different delivery shifts.

### 2. **Run the Program**

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. **Output**

- **Console Output**: Initial solution, best solution, and final cost.
- **Visualization**: A plot displaying routes for each shift with distinct styles.
